### About me :dizzy: 

:dna: I'm a bioinformatician in Patrick Chinnery's lab. 
I am currently doing my PhD, I am studying cellular effects of mitochondrial DNA mutations in multiple animal models and tissues. 
My passion is single cell analyses as they allow to study biological events at the deepest resolution possible.
One of the lessons I have learned so far is that communication between wet and dry lab is of primary importance and I will seek this dialog throughout my career.

:woman_technologist: My background is in computational biology, I have graduated with top marks at both bachelor and master's degree.
I find Cambridge a very stimulating environment, I am finally becoming the scientist I have alwayse wanted to be.
